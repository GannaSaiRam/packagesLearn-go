# packagesLearn-go
This is used to have some understanding of packages used in better and crux way.

If you are a beginner, and syntactically weak. I prefer to check out [Go](https://go.dev/play/).

Packages are sorted in the I felt those need to be learnt as a beginner to feel the greatness in this language.

### Note
While checking out any folder, I prefer to have main function inside main folder of each package. 

And building module used will be as of same name as the folder name.
